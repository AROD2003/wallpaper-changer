# wallpaper-changer
changes wallpaper, depending on what time of day it is

just a simple app i made for myself, so the code will be messy. it uses the jna library for native methods.

everything you need is on this github page, so feel free to modify the code for yourself :) 


note:
  String dayWallpaper = "E:\\day-wallpaper.jpg";
	String nightWallpaper = "E:\\night-wallpaper2.jpg";
  
if you plan to modify the code, you'll need to change these values to something in your project, or hard drive. 
i just pointed it to 2 pictures in my hard drive for ease of use
